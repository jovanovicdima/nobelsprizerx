Using the principles of Reactive Programming and the Nobel Prize API, implement an application to display the names of Nobel Prize laureates,
the category in which they won the prize, and the year they won the prize. Use the https://api.nobelprize.org/2.1/nobelPrizes endpoint.
When making the call, pass the appropriate range of years for which the data will be retrieved. For the collected data,
determine the average awarded monetary prize (use the prizeAmountAdjusted property). Display the obtained results.
